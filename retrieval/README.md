# retrieval module

This folder implements a lightweight TF–IDF + cosine similarity retrieval module used for demonstration and reproducibility.

Files:
- `tfidf_index.py`: build a TF–IDF index
- `cosine_search.py`: retrieve top-k documents with cosine similarity

This is a proof-of-concept implementation aligned with the manuscript's retrieval component.
