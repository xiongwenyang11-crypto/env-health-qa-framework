Study information:
Study design: Case-crossover study
Region: Europe
Year: 2021

Population:
Children aged 6 to 14 years living in urban areas.

Exposure:
Short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), measured using daily ambient monitoring data.

Health outcome:
Asthma symptom exacerbation and emergency department visits.

Key findings:
Short-term increases in NO2 concentration were associated with higher odds of asthma symptom exacerbation.
The strongest associations were observed during periods of high traffic-related air pollution.

Conclusion:
Elevated short-term NO2 exposure may contribute to increased asthma morbidity in children.
