# Demonstration Corpus

This folder contains a small **synthetic demonstration corpus** used solely to illustrate the retrieval, extractive summarization, and qualitative uncertainty calibration pipeline of the interpretable environmental health question-answering framework.

All texts in this folder are **synthetic or illustrative examples** created to mirror the structural characteristics of environmental health studies (e.g., study design, population, exposure, and outcomes).  
They are provided exclusively for demonstrating method workflows, data structures, and reproducibility.

The files in this folder **do NOT represent real studies**, do NOT correspond to the literature corpus analyzed in the accompanying manuscript, and do NOT constitute factual evidence.

Full-text source articles and real study texts are not redistributed due to copyright restrictions.
