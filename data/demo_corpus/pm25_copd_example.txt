Study information:
Study design: Prospective cohort study
Region: North America
Year: 2019

Population:
Adults aged 45 to 80 years with a history of chronic respiratory disease.

Exposure:
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), assessed as annual average concentration.

Health outcome:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization.

Key findings:
Participants exposed to higher long-term PM2.5 concentrations experienced a higher frequency of COPD exacerbations.
The association remained after adjustment for age, smoking status, and socioeconomic factors.

Conclusion:
Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risk of COPD exacerbations.
